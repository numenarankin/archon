/**
 * Curated, always-in-context memory for a project's agent (Tier 1
 * of the project agent's memory; the on-demand transcript tools are Tier 2).
 *
 * One evolving summary per project, regenerated from the prior memory + the
 * latest conversation after each turn. This is what lets the project agent feel
 * like it already knows the project "second-hand" — without stuffing every raw
 * message into context, and without RAG's lossy top-k recall for what is really
 * a continuity/state problem.
 *
 * MISSION-CRITICAL bias handling: conversation history is full of speculation
 * and hopeful framing. The summariser is instructed to TYPE every item as
 * established (grounded in project data) vs provisional (discussed/hypothesised)
 * and to never promote a hypothesis to fact. The project page prompt then
 * treats provisional memory as provisional. This keeps memory from amplifying
 * confirmation bias. Project memory is also isolated from the platform-wide
 * `agent_memory` (user-level facts) — it never crosses projects or into the
 * global agent.

const SUMMARISER_SYSTEM = `You maintain the working memory of an oil & gas \
project's analysis assistant. You are given the existing project \
memory and the most recent conversation, and you produce an updated memory \
document. This memory is injected into the assistant's context so it remembers \
the project across chats.

This is mission-critical: the memory must NOT become a vehicle for optimism or \
confirmation bias. Follow these rules exactly:
- TYPE every item. Only list something under "Established (grounded in data)" \
if the conversation shows it was confirmed against the project's actual files/\
data. Everything else — ideas, interpretations, hopes, leads — goes under \
"Provisional / hypotheses" and must be phrased as provisional.
- NEVER promote a hypothesis to an established fact. If the conversation merely \
discussed or assumed something, it stays provisional.
- Preserve durable items from the existing memory; integrate the new \
conversation; move resolved questions to decisions/established; drop nothing \
important. Record negative results and ruled-out ideas explicitly — they matter \
as much as positive ones.
- Be concise and neutral. No promotional language. Keep it under ~350 words.
